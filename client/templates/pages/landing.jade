          Keeping track of what get’s said over the phone can be tough. That’s why I
          created NoteDown: to help you stay organized while you’re on a call.
          NoteDown was designed to make it super easy to jot down thoughts,
          followup questions, todo items and anything else that comes to mind while
          you’re on a call. Just jot it down here and it will always be available 
          for you to review later. Best of all, it’s free! Dive right in, and check
          out the [about page](/about) if you want to know more about the project.
