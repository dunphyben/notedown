      Keeping track of what get’s said over the phone can be tough. That’s why I
      created StenoTyper: to help you stay organized while you’re on a call.
      StenoTyper was designed to make it super easy to jot down thoughts,
      followup questions, todo items and anything else that comes to mind while
      you’re on a call. Just jot it down here and it will always be available 
      for you to review later. Best of all, it’s free! Dive right in, and check
      out the [about page](/about) if you want to know more about the project.
